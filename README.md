RL24 homework1

I tried to push the three packages on github but it had some bugs so i could not upload they, but I comprimed they in a zip file so for now I think it's good, maybe tomorrow I'll try again.

However, the arm_description package implemnts the first task so URDF+Rviz and the command for run in it's "ros2 launch arm_description display.launch.py"

For the second and third task (URDF.XACRO+Gazebo), the launch command is "ros2 launch arm_gazebo arm_world.launch.py"

And for the last one (the node) the command is "ros2 run arm_control control_node"
